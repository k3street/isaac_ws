# Files Marked for Deletion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Review Before Deleting

These files have been identified as non-essential to the core system functionality based on the AGENT_HANDOFF.md analysis. However, **review each file before permanent deletion**.

## Core System Functions (PRESERVED):
‚úÖ **ROS2 Camera Control** - Core camera control functionality  
‚úÖ **Asset Management** - Production-ready asset downloader and inventory  
‚úÖ **Camera Control** - LLM-powered and manual camera control  
‚úÖ **Scenario Management** - Scenario generation and loading  

## Categories of Files in This Folder:

### üîÑ Duplicate/Old Implementations
Files that have been superseded by newer, better implementations in the main workspace.

### üß™ Demo/Development Files  
Development demonstrations and experimental code that were used during development but are not needed for production.

### üöÄ Failed Isaac Sim Launch Attempts
Multiple attempts to launch Isaac Sim that failed due to Python compatibility issues. The working solution is `camera_control_node_isaac_only.py`.

### üìÑ Redundant Documentation
Documentation that has been superseded by newer, more comprehensive guides.

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Artifacts
Scripts and files used during development that are no longer needed.

## Before Deleting This Folder:
1. ‚úÖ Verify the main system still works: `python3 camera_control_node_isaac_only.py`
2. ‚úÖ Verify ROS2 system works: `ros2 launch isaac_test llm_camera_controller_simple.launch.py llm_provider:=simulation`  
3. ‚úÖ Verify asset management works: `python3 asset_inventory.py`
4. ‚úÖ Verify camera CLI works: `python3 camera_cli.py reset`
